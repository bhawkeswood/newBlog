Since I'm doing this whole New Years resolution blog thing I declared on Medium yesterday, and since I have no interest in pissing off Medium or the good folks who read on Medium, I'm decided to get my own blog.
Coding being the big part of ym New Years resolution, I thought I'd build the blog, rather than using something that already exists!

Yay me!
